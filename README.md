## Description

*AlmanacJS* is an application built for the purpose of aspiring progammers, particularly JavaScript developers. Just like how authors may use calendars with "Word-Of-The-Day", or Eminem use to spend hours reading a dictionary to expand his lexicon to have a greater breadth of vocabulary in his songs, programmers stand to benefit about different and new methods to implement in their code down the road. *AlmanacJS* was created for that explicit purpose.

Upon loading the page, a random method will be generated from the database. Below it will be the syntax of the method, a description of what it does, and, if available, an example that can be performed drawn from *MDN Web Docs*, contained within an iframe.

At the top of the page, there are three buttons: like, dislike, and "RANDOM(METHOD)>". The like and dislike buttons appear for each generated method, so that other users can rate the method, in accordance to personal preference or experience to their utilization. The "RANDOM(METHOD)>" generates another method on the page.
